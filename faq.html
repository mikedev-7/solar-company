                At Craftship Technical Services Limited, We know solar power! We get a lot of specific 
                questions about our solar panels, So we thought it would be a great idea to provide our 
                customers and viewers with a place to see some commonly asked questions. We have put
                 together a comprehensive list on varous solar energy topics, and we will update
                  with more questions as they arise. We hope you enjoy this FAQ's page.

                      <p class="question-text">  As sunlight cascades on tqheue solar psatnel, A chemical reaction takes place and Direct 
                        Current (DC) power is produced. The DC power flows to an inverter whwere the DC power
                         is transformd into Alternating Current (AC power). This AC power is what the electric grid 
                         and your home runs on. The poweror energy then flow to power your home or directly to the 
                         electic grid. You can also divert the energy 
                         from solar panels to a battery to store excess energy. Batteries also operates as DC power.
